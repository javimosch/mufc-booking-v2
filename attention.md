### Analysis of Completed Feature: CLI CRUD Organization WebUI Users

The `progress.md` file marks "[X] CRUD organization WebUI users" under the CLI section as completed.

Upon examining the implementation in `src/cli/webui-user.js`, the code includes functions for `listWebUIUsers`, `addWebUIUser`, `updateWebUIUser`, and `deleteWebUIUser`, which cover the basic CRUD operations for WebUI users.

Areas for potential missing implementation or improvement include:

-   **Email Uniqueness Validation:** The `addWebUIUser` function checks if required fields are present and if the organization exists, but it does not explicitly check for the uniqueness of the email address before creating a new user.
-   **Password Complexity/Validation:** While the password is being hashed using `bcrypt`, there is no validation on the complexity or length of the password provided by the user.
-   **Update User Fields:** The `updateWebUIUser` function only allows updating the password. It might be desirable to allow updating other fields like the associated organization.
-   **Confirmation Prompts:** Similar to organization management, there are no confirmation prompts before deleting a WebUI user, which could lead to accidental deletion.
